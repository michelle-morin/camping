# _Camping Trip Planner_

#### _Team Week Project for Epicodus_, _Feb. 17-20, 2020_

#### By _**Michelle Morin, Patrick Kille, Matt Taylor, Joseph Wangemann, Alex Skreen**_

## Description

_This application allows a user to organize a camping trip. The webpage allows a user to input their name, start and end dates for the trip, and a destination (Town, State) and, once submitted, displays a trip planning interface. Users can add other campers to the attendee list, add items to-be-packed to a collective packing list, and assign to-be-packed items to individual attendees by dragging the items from the collective packing list and dropping the items into an individual's packing list area. The webpage also displays current weather information (temperature, humidity, sunrise and sunset times) as well as local trail information for the user's input location._

## Project Concept:

_We defined the minimum viable product (MVP) for this application as a webpage that allows a user to enter their name, a start and end date for a trip, and a trip location (e.g., Town, State) into a form and then receive a visually pleasing drag-and-drop interface to coordinate a packing list for the trip. The interface would allow the trip organizer to add campers to the trip and add items to be packed to a collective packing list. The interface would also, at a minimum, include designated areas for collective shared items to be packed, individual list areas for each camper, and the ability to drag items from the collective shared items area to an individual list area. The MVP also included incorporating trail information for trails nearby the user's input trip location, using the Hiking Project Data API._

_We defined various stretch goals for our project, including:_
* using the Open Weather Map API to display weather information (temperature, sunrise/sunset times, etc.) for the user's input trip location. We accomplished this stretch goal, but the API currently retrieves _current_ weather rather than weather for the user's input dates. Retrieving weather for a specified date range is a paid service of the Open Weather Maps API that we did not invest in for this project, but could be easily integrated.
* figuring out a local storage option, so that a user could save a trip's information and return to it later (e.g., anytime before cache is cleared) rather than planning a whole trip in one sitting. A stretch strech goal of this concept would be to allow users to contribute to the list from separate computers (e.g., each camper can sign into a trip once added, then contribute to trip planning simultaneously). Current status: when a user starts a trip (upon splash screen form submission), adds a new attendee, or clicks the "finalize trip" button, all camper names and items within the campers' respective cards is stored in local storage.
* sending an email to each camper confirming their packing list once the trip packing is finalized (e.g., after a user clicks a "finalize trip" button on the main page)
* incorporating the ability to delete campers and items once added. Current status: we added functionality to delete items from the page by dragging the item over a trash icon. We also added the ability to delete a camper (except the trip organizer, who is not able to be deleted) by clicking anywhere in the card header for the to-be-deleted camper. Deletion of a camper is permitted once all items in that camper's card are removed, otherwise a modal appears instructing users to remove items before deleting the camper.
